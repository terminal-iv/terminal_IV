## terminal_IV game design principles:

### Framework-First Design

To reflect the game's DIY "hacker" ethos, frameworks for writing custom abilities, items, etc will be presented front-and-centre. Wherever possible, lists will be presented as examples/quick-start options for new players rather than prescribed choices. 
The "Hacking The Game" section will be split up into robust question-and-answer-based frameworks for hacking each individual part of the game.

### Modular Rules

Inspired by the Unix philosophy, terminal_IV's rules will be minimal and
modular, split into bite-sized discrete self-contained sections inspired by PBTA moves with clear triggers; players need only engage with rules with trigger conditions that are currently active. 

### T_IV's Not BITD
...but it shouldn't introduce too many minor rules alterations to keep track of. We aim to introduce departures from the original BITD ruleset judiciously to maximise the impact of the major changes while minimising the amount of subtle deviations players will have to remember.

There'll be more, but it's these three for now.
