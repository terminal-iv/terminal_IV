# DESCRIPTION
_If_ your character takes challenging and dangerous action, _then_ you make an **action roll** to see how it turns out. 

An action is challenging if there’s an obstacle to your PC’s goal, and it’s dangerous if something bad could happen if you failed (or failed to act). If the action is something we’d expect the character to simply accomplish, then it just happens; we don’t make an action roll unless the PC is put to the test. How exactly your group defines what "challenging" and “dangerous” mean will help establish the tone and style of your Terminal_IV series.

You don't get to do an action roll until we actually see your character take daring action on-screen. In Apocalypse World parlance: "to do it, do it". 

## ABOUT THE ACTION ROLL
The action roll does a lot of work for you. It tells you how well your character performs as well as how serious the consequences are for them. They might succeed at their action without any consequences (on a 6), or they might succeed but suffer consequences (on a 4-5), or it might just all go wrong (on a 1-3).

Since NPCs don't roll for their actions, an action roll does double-duty: it resolves the action of the PC as well as any NPCs that are involved. The single roll tells us how those actions interact and which consequences result. On a 6, the PC wins and has their effect. On a 4/5, it's a mix; both the PC and the NPC have their effect. On a 1-3, the NPC wins and has their effect as a consequence on the PC.

## THE DICE POOL

Your Action Roll dice pool may comprise up to 3 **Action Dice** (the Skill, Specialty, Mastery dice) plus the **Boost Die** and the **Cyber Die** for a maximum of 5d. You can still attempt an action roll with 0d in your dice pool (see step 6 and good luck). 

The 6 processes to build the pool, roll, and interpret the results are as follows:

# 1: GOAL (YOU OWN THIS PROCESS)
State your goal: the concrete outcome your character will achieve when they overcome the obstacle at hand.
 
Usually the character's goal is obvious in context, but it's the Admin’s job to ask questions to clarify when necessary.

# 2: CHOOSE AN ACTION AND BUILD INITIAL DICE POOL (YOU OWN THIS PROCESS)
Choose the action rating that best fits the action your character is taking in the fiction. 

The same fictional action may be covered by more than one action rating, by design; the action rating you choose determines how your action is presented "on-screen". For example: stabbing someone with **Burn** may centre passion and anger; with **Execute**, precision and speed; with **Bruteforce**, well- you can work that one out. 

Add a number of dice to your dice pool based on your skill level in that action rating:

**-S** **--skill**
: This is an action you're skilled at. Add **1d**: the **Skill Die**.

**-P**, **--specialty**
: This is your specialty. Add **2d**: the **Skill Die** and **Specialty Die**.

**-M**, **--mastery**
: You are widely acknowledged as a master in this field. Add **3d**: the **Skill Die**, **Specialty Die**, and **Mastery Die**.

You set your starting skill levels in the various action ratings during **character creation** and upgrade them through **character advancement**.

# 3: POSITION OPTIONS (ADMIN OWNS THIS PROCESS)
The Admin sets the **position** for the roll. The position represents how dangerous the action is and how screwed you are if things go wrong. By default, an action roll is risky. 

**-c**, **--controlled**
: You act on your terms. You exploit a dominant advantage.

**-r**, **--risky**
: You go head to head. You act under fire. You take a chance.

**-d**, **--desperate**
: You overreach your capabilities. You’re in serious trouble. At least you get to **mark XP**.

## ABOUT POSITION

# 4: EFFECT OPTIONS (ADMIN OWNS THIS PROCESS)
The Admin assesses the likely **effect level** of this action, given the situation; "how much" can this action accomplish? Effect levels from low to high:

**-z**, **--zero**
: You’re trying to do something currently impossible.

**-l**, **--limited**	
: 1 tick; you achieve a partial or weak effect. How is your impact diminished? What effort remains to achieve your goal?

**-s**, **--standard**	
: 2 ticks; you achieve what we’d expect as “normal” with this action. Is that enough, or is there more to do?

**-g**, **--great**
: 3 ticks; you achieve more than usual. How does the extra effort manifest? What additional benefits do you enjoy?

**-x**, **--extreme**
: 5 ticks; beyond great effect. You rule this scene. 

## ABOUT EFFECT

# 5: OTHER OPTIONS (YOU OWN THIS PROCESS)
**-B --boost**
: Add the **Boost Die** to your dice pool, by **pushing yourself** for a boost, accepting **assistance**, or making a **devil's bargain** (choose 1).

**-C --cyber**
: Add the **Cyber Die** to your dice pool by **leveraging cyberware**.

**-p --push**
: **Push yourself** to increase your effect level.

**-t --trade**
: Trade position for effect, or vice versa. 

# 6: RESOLVE THE ACTION ROLL (YOU AND THE ADMIN JOINTLY OWN THIS PROCESS)
Roll your dice pool. 

If you've got to this step and you still have 0d in your pool, then roll 2d and keep the lowest result (obviously, you can't crit). Sure, 97% of the time you'll face a consequence, but 25% of the time you'll get a success too; on Terminal_IV, 1 in 4 is still pretty good odds. 

## EXIT VALUES
 
**00**	66+	Crit Success		Success, with increased effect!
	
**0**	6	Full Success		You succeed in your action!
	
**1**	4-5	Partial Success		You succeed, but there are consequences
	
**2**	1-3	Bad Outcome	    	You fail, and there are consequences

## INTERPRETING THE RESULTS 
The Admin will judge the **effects** and **consequences** resulting from the roll as below:

**CONTROLLED POSITION**
You act on your terms. You exploit a dominant advantage.

**66+**: Critical! You do it with increased effect.

**6**:   You do it.

**4-5**: You hesitate. Withdraw and try a different approach, or else do it with a minor consequence: a minor complication occurs, you have reduced effect, you suffer lesser harm, you end up in a risky position.

**1-3**: You falter. Press on by seizing a risky opportunity, or withdraw and try a different approach.

Consequences here are less immediately dangerous, reflecting that you're acting from a position of control.

**RISKY POSITION**
You go head to head. You act under fire. You take a chance.

**66+**: Critical! You do it with increased effect.

**6**:   You do it.

**4-5**: You do it, but there's a consequence: you suffer harm, a complication occurs, you have reduced effect, you end up in a desperate position.

**1-3**: Things go badly. You suffer harm, a complication occurs, you end up in a desperate position, you lose this opportunity.

**DESPERATE POSITION**
You overreach your capabilities. You're in serious trouble.

**66+**: Critical! You do it with increased effect.

**6**:   You do it.

**4-5**: You do it, but there's a consequence: you suffer severe harm, a serious complication occurs, you have reduced effect.

**1-3**: It's the worst outcome. You suffer severe harm, a serious complication occurs, you lose this opportunity for action.

On a 1-3, it's up to the Admin to decide if the PC's action has any effect or not, or if it even happens at all. Usually, the action just fails completely, but in some circumstances, it might make sense or be more interesting for the action to have some effect even on a 1-3 result.

Consequences - REWRITE THIS BIT
When a PC suffers an effect from an enemy or a dangerous situation, it's called a consequence. Consequences are the companion to effects. PCs have effect on the world around them and they suffer consequences in return from the risks they face.

Each 4-5 and 1-3 outcome lists suggested consequences for the character. The worse your position, the worse the consequences are. The GM can inflict one or more of these consequences, depending on the circumstances of the action roll. PCs have the ability to avoid or reduce the severity of consequences that they suffer by resisting them.

# NOTE
In no circumstances may your dice pool for the action roll exceed 5d unless, you've hacked together some questionably-balanced custom ability that lets you do that and your Admin actually approved it, in which case that's a you problem. 



















# TO DO:


When you narrate the action after the roll, you and the Admin collaborate to say what happens on-screen. Use the following table as a guide:


Include notes on dice roll probability 

"effects in the fiction"/"why we do this" sections etc not in the SRD


Effect
In Blades in the Dark, you achieve goals by taking actions and facing consequences. But how many actions does it take to achieve a particular goal? That depends on the effect level of your actions. The GM judges the effect level using the profiles below. Which one best matches the action at hand -- great, standard, or limited? Each effect level indicates the questions that should be answered for that effect, as well as how many segments to tick if you're using a progress clock.
Effect Levels



Assessing Factors
To assess effect level, first start with your gut feeling, given this situation. Then, if needed, assess three factors that may modify the effect level: potency, scale, and quality. If the PC has an advantage in a given factor, consider a higher effect level. If they have a disadvantage, consider a reduced effect level.
Potency
The potency factor considers particular weaknesses, taking extra time or a bigger risk, or the influence of arcane powers. An infiltrator is more potent if all the lights are extinguished and they move about in the dark.
Quality/Tier
Quality represents the effectiveness of tools, weapons, or other resources, usually summarized by Tier. Fine items count as +1 bonus in quality, stacking with Tier.
Thorn is picking the lock to a safehouse run of a gang renowned for Occult dealings. Her crew is Tier I and she has fine lock picks - so she's effectively Tier II. The Occult gang is Tier III. Thorn is outclassed in quality, so her effect will be limited on the lock.
Scale
Scale represents the number of opponents, size of an area covered, scope of influence, etc. Larger scale can be an advantage or disadvantage depending on the situation. In battle, more people are better. When infiltrating, more people are a hindrance.
When considering factors, effect level might be reduced below limited, resulting in zero effect—or increased beyond great, resulting in an extreme effect.
If a PC special ability gives "+1 effect," it comes into play after the GM has assessed the effect level. For example, if you ended up with zero effect, the +1 effect bonus from your Cutter's Bodyguard ability would bump them up to limited effect.
Also, remember that a PC can push themselves (take 2 stress) to get +1 effect on their action.
Every factor won't always apply to every situation. You don't have to do an exact accounting every time, either. Use the factors to help you make a stronger judgment call—don't feel beholden to them.












Setting Position & Effect
The GM sets position and effect for an action roll at the same time, after the player says what they're doing and chooses their action. Usually, Risky / Standard is the default combination, modified by the action being used, the strength of the opposition, and the effect factors.
The ability to set position and effect as independent variables gives you nine combinations to choose from, to help you convey a wide array of fictional circumstances.
For example, if a character is facing off alone against a small enemy gang, the situation might be:
She fights the gang straight up, rushing into their midst, hacking away in a wild Skirmish. In this case, being threatened by the larger force lowers her position to indicate greater risk, and the scale of the gang reduces her effect (Desperate / Limited).
She fights the gang from a choke-point, like a narrow alleyway where their numbers can't overwhelm her at once. She's not threatened by several at once, so her risk is similar to a one-on-one fight, but there's still a lot of enemies to deal with, so her effect is reduced (Risky / Limited).
She doesn't fight the gang, instead trying to maneuver her way past them and escape. She's still under threat from many enemy attacks, so her position is worse, but if the ground is open and the gang can't easily corral her, then her effect for escaping isn't reduced (Desperate / Standard). If she had some immediate means of escape (like leaping onto a speeding carriage), then her effect might even be increased (Desperate / Great).
The gang isn't aware of her yet—she's set up in a sniper position on a nearby roof. She takes a shot against one of them. Their greater numbers aren't a factor, so her effect isn't reduced, and she's not immediately in any danger (Controlled / Great). Maybe instead she wants to fire off a salvo of suppressing fire against the whole gang, in which case their scale applies (Controlled / Limited). If the gang is on guard for potential trouble, her position is more dangerous (Risky / Great). If the gang is alerted to a sniper, then the effect may be reduced further, as they scatter and take cover (Risky / Limited). If the gang is able to muster covering fire while they fall back to a safe position, then things are even worse for our scoundrel (Desperate / Limited).
