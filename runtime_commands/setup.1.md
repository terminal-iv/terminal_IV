# NAME
setup - take action to set teammates up for success

# SYNOPSIS
**setup** [*ACTION*]...

# DESCRIPTION
_If_ you take action to indirectly assist a teammate’s future action, _then_ you perform a **setup** action; if your action has its intended result, any ally who follows through on your action gets **+1 effect level** or **improved position** for their roll. You choose the benefit, based on the nature of your setup action.

# NOTE
This is good for creating distractions; contributing to an operation when you don’t have a good rating in the action at hand; tackling opposition that has advantages in quality, scale and/or potency. Multiple follow-up actions may take advantage of your setup (including someone leading a group action) as long as it makes sense in the fiction.
If you're wondering if this is _really_ a rule in its own right: it isn't, it's merely a consequence of position and effect doing its thing. This just codifies something you could do anyway as its own mechanic for convenience.
